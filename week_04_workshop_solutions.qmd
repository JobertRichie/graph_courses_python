# Dataset Description

*The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).*

# Data Import and Overview

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from itables import show

# Load the dataset
tb_pathways_df = pd.read_csv("week_04_workshop/data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
show(tb_pathways_df.head())
```

# Geographic Context

![Map of Tamil Nadu, India](images/tndistrict_1.png)

# Relationship Between Age and Alcohol Use

```{python}
# Create a violin plot of Alcohol Use vs. Age
fig = px.violin(
    tb_pathways_df,
    box=True,
    points="all",
    x="Age",
    y="Alcohol",
    title="Alcohol Use vs Age",
    labels={"Age": "Age (years)", "Alcohol": "Alcohol Use (binary)"},
)
fig.show()
```

Insert appropriate interpretation here.

# Highlighted Numbers with Inline Code (Optional Section)

```{python}
# Maximum first visit cost
max_first_visit_cost = int(tb_pathways_df["first visit cost"].max())

# Minimum first visit cost
min_first_visit_cost = int(tb_pathways_df["first visit cost"].min())

# Most common form of TB
most_common_form_of_tb = tb_pathways_df["Form of TB"].mode()[0]
```

The maximum first visit cost was `{python} max_first_visit_cost`, and the minimum was `{python} min_first_visit_cost`. The most common form of TB in the dataset is `{python} most_common_form_of_tb`.
